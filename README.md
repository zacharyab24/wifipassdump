Code that retrieves stored wifi passwords on windows using windows api \
I did not come up with this idea or code. Credit goes to [John Hammond on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@_JohnHammond/videos). I just copied his code from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auGJJOfmrMM). Please check out his content. \

Running this code will list all wifi networks your windows device has previously connected to, the security type for said network. and the password \
As with all cybersecurity related stuff, use only for educational purposes and if you do not own the device, make sure you have the owner's consent before running the script
